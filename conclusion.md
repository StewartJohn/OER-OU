# Conclusion

Open Educational Resources (OER) have advantages for faculty and students. For students, they can increase access to course materials and offer a significant cost savings. For faculty, OER represent a chance to access, modify, and share content. OER can expand one's pedagogical reach, moving from teaching students around an institution to potentially teaching students from around the world.

This class has hopefully given you the tools to take the next step into OER.
